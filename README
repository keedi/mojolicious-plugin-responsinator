NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Responsinator - Simulate screen sizes

VERSION
    0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This module allow you to embed a given web page inside an iframe to see
    how it would look on different screens.

    This is probably just a module you want to use while developing, and not
    bundle it with the final application. Example usage:

      sub startup {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->plugin("responsinator") if $ENV{ENABLE_RESPONSINATOR};
      }

SYNOPSIS
    You need to enable the plugin in your Mojolicious application:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;
      plugin "responsinator";
      get "/" => sub { shift->render(text => "test\n") };
      app->start;

    Then from the browser, you can ask for an URL with the "_size" param to
    embed a website inside an iframe. Example:

      http://localhost:3000/some/path?_size=iphone          # iphone landscape
      http://localhost:3000/some/path?_size=iphone:portrait # iphone portrait
      http://localhost:3000/some/path?_size=100x400         # width: 100px; height: 400px

PREDEFINED SIZES
    You can replace "iphone" in the example above with any of the predefined
    sizes below:

    *   iphone

    *   iphone-5

    *   ipad

    *   wildfire

    *   nexus-4

METHODS
  register
      $self->reqister($app, \%config);
      $app->plugin(responsinator => \%config);

    Will register an "around_dispatch" hook, which will trigger on the
    "_size" query param. %config can contain:

    *   param

        Use this to specify another query param than the default "_size".
